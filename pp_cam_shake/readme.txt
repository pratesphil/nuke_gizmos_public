How to use:
- Place the database of shakes somewhere on your network where all users can get access to the shake curve files
- Put the pp_cam_shake node in nuke and select the database path
- Using the custom axis you can add new shakes to the database, it is best if your shake starts at frame 1 for export 
(plans to automatically offet curves back to 1 based on first keyframe in the future)

Enjoy!
